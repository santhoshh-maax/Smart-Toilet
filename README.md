# 🚽 Smart Toilet Monitoring System with Telegram Integration [![Sponsor](https://img.shields.io/badge/Sponsor-GitHub-db61a2?style=flat&logo=github-sponsors)](https://github.com/sponsors/santhoshh-maax)

An IoT-based Smart Toilet Monitoring System built using **ESP32** that monitors toilet occupancy, air quality, humidity, water level, and environmental conditions. The system automatically controls connected devices and sends real-time notifications to a Telegram bot for remote monitoring.


---

## 📖 Project Overview

This project aims to improve public restroom management using IoT technology. Multiple sensors continuously monitor the toilet environment while the ESP32 processes sensor data and sends instant updates to Telegram.

The system can automatically:

- Detect human presence
- Monitor gas concentration
- Monitor humidity and temperature
- Detect water level
- Control humidifier
- Control water pump
- Display information on LCD
- Send Telegram notifications
